# Home Assistant Neviweb Custom Component
# moving to a new file structure to follow HA 0.88 update with patch for 0.89

Here is a custom component to suport [Neviweb](https://neviweb.com/) in [Home Assistant](http://www.home-assistant.io). Neviweb is a platform created by Sinopé Technologies to interact with their smart devices like thermostats, light switches/dimmers and load controllers. It also supports some devices made by [Ouellet](http://www.ouellet.com/en-ca/products/thermostats-and-controls/neviweb%C2%AE-wireless-communication-controls.aspx).

## Supported Devices
Here is a list of currently supported devices. Basically, it's everything that can be added in Neviweb.
- Thermostats
  - Sinopé TH1120RF-3000 Line voltage thermostat
  - Sinopé TH1120RF-4000 Line voltage thermostat
  - Sinopé TH1121RF-3000 Thermostat for public areas
  - Sinopé TH1121RF-4000 Thermostat for public areas
  - Sinopé TH1300RF Floor heating thermostat
  - Sinopé TH1400RF Low voltage thermostat
  - Sinopé TH1500RF Double-pole thermostat
  - *Ouellet OTH2750-GT Line voltage thermostat
  - *Ouellet OTH3600-GA-GT Floor heating thermostat
- Lighting
  - Sinopé SW2500RF Light switch
  - Sinopé DM2500RF Dimmer 
- Specialized Control
  - Sinopé RM3200RF Load controller 40A
  - Sinopé RM3250RF Load controller 50A

*Not tested, but should be working well. Your feedback is appreciated if a device doesn't work.

## Prerequisite
You need to connect your devices to a GT125 web gateway and add them in your Neviweb portal before being able to interact with them within Home Assistant. Please refer to the instructions manual of your device or visit [Neviweb support](https://www.sinopetech.com/blog/support-cat/plateforme-nevi-web/).

## Installation
1. Download the zip file of this repository using the top right, green download button.
1. Extract the zip file on your computer, then copy the entire `custom_components` folder inside your Home Assistant `config` directory (where you can find your `configuration.yaml` file).
1. Your config directory should look like this:

    ```
    config/
      configuration.yaml
      custom_components/
        neviweb/
          __init__.py
          light.py
          switch.py
          climate.py
      ...
    ```

## Configuration

To enable Neviweb management in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file, then restart Home Assistant.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
neviweb:
  username: '<your Neviweb username>'
  password: '<your Neviweb password>'
```

**Configuration options:**  

| key | required | default | description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| **username** | yes |  | Your email address used to log in Neviweb.
| **password** | yes |  | Your Neviweb password.
| **network** | no | 1st network found | The name of the network you want to control.
| **scan_interval** | no | 900 | The number of seconds between access to Neviweb to update device state. Sinopé asked for a minimum of 5 minutes between polling now so you can reduce scan_interval to 300.

## Troubleshooting
If you get a stack trace related to a Neviweb component in your `home-assistant.log` file, you can file an issue in this repository.

You can also post in one of those threads to get help:

### Turning on Neviweb debug messages in `home-assistant.log` file

To have a maximum of information to help you, please provide a snippet of your `home-assistant.log` file. I've added some debug log messages that could help diagnose the problem.

Add thoses lines to your `configuration.yaml` file
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: warning
     logs:
       custom_components.neviweb: debug
   ```
This will set default log level to warning for all your components, except for Neviweb which will display more detailed messages.

## Customization
Install Custom UI and add the following in your code:

Icons for heat level: create folder www in the root folder .homeassistant/www
copy the six icons there. You can find them under local/www
feel free to improve my icons and let me know. (See icon_view2.png)

For each thermostat add this code in `customize.yaml`
```yaml
climate.neviweb_climate_thermostat_name:
  templates:
    entity_picture: >
      if (attributes.heat_level < 1) return '/local/heat-0.png';
      if (attributes.heat_level < 21) return '/local/heat-1.png';
      if (attributes.heat_level < 41) return '/local/heat-2.png';
      if (attributes.heat_level < 61) return '/local/heat-3.png';
      if (attributes.heat_level < 81) return '/local/heat-4.png';
      return '/local/heat-5.png';
 ```  
 In `configuration.yaml` add this
```yaml
customize: !include customize.yaml
``` 

## Current Limitations
- Home Assistant doesn't support operation mode selection for light and switch entities. So you won't see any dropdown list in the UI where you can switch between Auto and Manual mode. You can only see the current mode in the attributes. TODO: register a new service to change operation_mode and another one to set away mode.

- If you're looking for the away mode in the Lovelace 'thermostat' card, you need to click on the three dots button on the top right corner of the card. That will pop a window were you'll find the away mode switch at the bottom.

## TO DO
- Document each available services for every platforms + available attributes.
- Explore how to automatically setup sensors in HA that will report the states of a specific device attribute (i.e. the wattage of a switch device)
